This is a question skeleton bank.
We manually annotated the skeleton structure of 10K questions. In specific, it contains all the 5,166 questions in GraphQuestions and 5,000 question in ComplexWebQuestions: 3000 from the training sets, 1,000 from the validation set, and 1,000 from the test set.
We made this resource public to support future research (question understanding or semantic parsing research).
